In some projects, we needed to conduct experiments using Design of Experiments (DOE). With more than three input parameters in each project, the primary design matrix was a full factorial design with 9 tests and 2 replicates, totaling 11 tests. However, as the number of input parameters increased, a full factorial design became impractical due to limited resources. Therefore, we needed to choose alternative DOE methods to reduce the number of tests.

To select the best design matrix, we evaluated at least four different options, including Box-Behnken, Central Composite Design (CCD), D-optimal, full factorial, and Taguchi methods. To avoid redundancy among the selected matrices, we required a code to identify and merge similar tests across the compared designs, allowing us to use the same output to fulfill different DOE requirements. It was crucial that we also adhered to the principles of randomization and replication.
